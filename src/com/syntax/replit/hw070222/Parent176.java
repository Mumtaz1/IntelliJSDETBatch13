    *** Follow Steps carefully
    Step1: Create Parent Interface as ParentInterface
           that will have undefined method parentMethod
           without parameters.
    Step2: Create an Interface as ChildInterface that
           will be a child interface of ParentInterface
           and will have a method childMethod without
           parameters.
    Step3: Inherit the Main class to child Interface.
    Step4: Execute both methods.
    Expected Output:
    Parent Method-welcome to Syntax
    Child Method-hello Syntax
