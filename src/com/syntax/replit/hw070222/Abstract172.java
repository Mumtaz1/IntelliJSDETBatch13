    Abstraction:
    Create a Parent class in which you will have
    1 implemented method m2 and 1 unimplemented
    method m1.
    Make Main class to be a derived class from Parent.
    In main method execute both methods.
    Expected Output:
    Child class providing implementation
    Parent class providing implementation

    //So a class can be derived from the base class in Java by using the extends keyword
