    ** Follow steps carefully.
    Step1: Create Interface as FirstInterface and create
           undefined method as firstMethod (without parameter)
    Step2: Create another interface as SecondInterface in
           which you create a method as secondMethod
           (Without Parameter).
    Step3: Inherit both interfaces to Main class.
    Step4: Execute both methods.
    Expected Output:
    First Method implementing multiple Inheritance
    Second Method implementing multiple Inheritance
