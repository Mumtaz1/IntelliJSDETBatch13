What is Inheritance?
    Is a mechanism in Java through which one class acquires the properties and methods of
    another class. It is one of the main four pillars of OOPS.

Why we should use Inheritance?
    1. It helps reduce the amount of code we have to write.
    2. It is more efficient.
    3. Saves memory.

How we can use Inheritance:
    We can use the extends keyword after the class name and then the name of the
    class from which we want to inherit the code. Example is given below:
    class Parent {
    String name = "Newton";
    String eyeColor = "brown";
    }
    class Child extends Parent {
    public void  printInfor() {
    System.out.println(name + " " + eyeColor);
    }
    }

Types of Inheritance:
    Different languages support different types of inheritance but 5 are very common.
    1. Single Inheritance
    2. Multilevel Inheritance
    3. Hierarchial Inheritance
    4. Multiple Inheritance
    5. Hybrid Inheritance.
