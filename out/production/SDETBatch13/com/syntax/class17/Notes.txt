Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in Java that help us control the access of
    classes, variables, methods, and other code of block. There are four
    access levels in Java: private, default (it is not a keyword),
    protected, and public. We have three keywords that define these
    access levels: 1. private, 2. protected, 3. public.

Private:
    When we use the private keyword with a method or field it is only
    accessible inside that class. It is the most restricted access
    modifier.

 Default (it is not a keyword):
    When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method
    then default access is applied by Java which means we can access this
    variable or method inside the same class as well as in all the other
    classes which exist inside the same package.

 Protected:
    When we have protected access modifier we can access that method or
    variable inside the same class, plus inside the other classes which
    are inside the same package, plus inside the classes which are in
    different packages as well but they must have an extends
    relationship with the original class.

 Public:
    When we use the public access modifier we can use that field or method
    anywhere inside the same project. We can access them in the class, plus
    in the package, plus in other packages, plus in the project.
