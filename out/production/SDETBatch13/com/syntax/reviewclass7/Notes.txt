Types of variables in Java:
    We have 3 types of variables: 1. Local, 2. instance, 3. static.

Local variables:
     Are the variables that we declare inside a block of code.
     upSide: They occupy the memory for shortest period of time.
     downSide: They cannot be accessed outside of that block in which they
               are declared.

Instance variables:
    Are the variables that are delared inside a class but outside a block of code.
    upSide: Can be accessed in all methods of a clas. They can have different values
          for each instance of that class. In line 9, 16, 28, 29, 33. for him in B13StringTester

Static variables:
     All the variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword
     they are called static variables.
     upSide:
     1. they only reserve a single memory location for all the instances of a class.
     2. they can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name.
     downSide:
     They occupy the memory for the longest period of time. They always store only one
     value for all the objects of that class.

Real life use:
    Most of the times you will storing constant values in static variables.
    Static is also used heavily with methods that don't involve instance variables.

Access modifiers:
    There are 3 access modifier keywords (private, protected, public) and
    4 access levels (private, default, protected, public) in Java.

Rules: Access modifiers can only be used with instance and static members of a class (fields
     and methods).

private:
    When we use private with any method or variable we can only access that method or
    variable in that class.

default (it is not a keyword):
    We can access that member inside the same class, inside the same package, and in
    other classes.

public:
    When we use the public access modifier with members of a class it is available
    throughout that project.

Real life use:
    99% of the time instance fields are private.
    99% of the time instance and static methods are public.
