What is super keyword?
    super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class object.

Why should we learn super keyword?
    1. If we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class
       then we can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable
       or method because by default Java prefers the variables of the child
       class. We can also call the super class constructor with the help of
       super with parenthesis e.g., super();

How to use super keyword:
    1. We can use super. method name or field name to call the method or to
       access the field of super class.
    2. We can use the super with parenthesis to call the super class
       constructor.

Rules:
    1. We can only access the immediate parent class constructor or
       field or method with the help of super keyword.
    2. We can only use super() inside the constructor.
    3. If we have a user created constructor in the parent class we
       must have a matching parameter constructor inside the child
       classes as well.
    4. If we have multiple constructors inside the parent as soon as
       one is matches we are good to go. We do not need to match each
       and every constructor from the parent class.
    5. super() should be the first line inside a constructor.

===================
Important to know before we start Selenium and good for interviews:
1. Arrays
2. Loops
3. If else conditions
4. methods
5. string class

Note 2D Arrays not so important.

Method Overloading:
    When same name method exists in a class but with different number
    of parameters or different type of parameters or different
    sequence of parameters it is called methodOverloading.

Why we should MethodOverloading?
    1. Makes your code more readable.
    2. Makes the life of the end user easy. They don't have to
       memorize many method names.

How we can use MethodOverloading?
    We can have same name methods but we have to follow the
    below rules:
    1. by passing different number of parameters
    2. we can change the datatype of parameters
    3. we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters.
